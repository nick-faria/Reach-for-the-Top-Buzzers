Ok so I only need to write two more methods to handle seeing whether the answer is correct or not and also for the pause before
the next question button is pressed. That last one i believe is called finish question or something, but its the easiest and 
you guyscan probably do that. Just add the method with the same structure as the unanswered loop method, but when next question is pressed
just end the loop and itll automatically go to the next question. Put it at the end of every for loop that cycles through questions, or 
for who am I at the very end of the question. For assigned, make it after the spot where the one person one the other team has a chance to
answer, im sure you can figure it out. Also you can test sending/receiving data with the sercom stuff which i think would be the best idea,
cause then I can finish my coding on the weekend myself. Just comment out everything else in the main.

Anyways my login is farin6002 and password is m4r5up1aL so that you dont have to set up the folders and all the librarys and shit to run it
dont mess up my stuff please
